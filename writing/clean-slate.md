## clean slate

hi folks,

welcome to this obscure corner of the internet where i hope to share my thoughts — mostly on ml, engineering, ai safety, oss, and the occasional wild idea that i pick up on . i’ve tried blogging before, but each time i gave up in less than half the time i spent setting things up. why? well, sometimes it was a lack of interest in writing, other times just the feeling that no one would care. i hope this time is different. to keep myself accountable, i’m writing this as a public commitment.

i’m starting with my google summer of code journey for a few reasons:

- there’s plenty to write about, so i can quickly get 3–4 posts out as i get started — external motivation!
- my path was a bit different: gsoc is mostly for college students, but i graduated last year and only recently got into oss. so “clean slate” felt like the perfect title.
- the application process can be daunting, so i hope these posts help someone out there.
- oss is amazing — anyone interested in engineering should give it a try, not just through gsoc.

as time and my interests permit, i’d love to branch out into more diverse topics and interaction. for example, i recently started working on [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), so maybe a post on how tensor objects in pytorch work, or a post on [cross coders](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/crosscoders/index.html) — I have a lot on my mind to write about. hopefully, i’ll get to share all of it here.

in conclusion, here’s my [first post](/writing/gsoc-selection) — one i hope will be useful to someone out there. i plan on writing a lot this summer, regardless of how much interaction or how many visits i get. still, i wouldn’t be lying if i said it would be fantastic if anyone who reads this and finds it remotely helpful would [reach out](/contact).
