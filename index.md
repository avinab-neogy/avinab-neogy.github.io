## about Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

hi! iâ€™m avinab. i graduated last year from bits goa with a major in mechanical engineering. along the way, i also took up courses in data science and finance to broaden my perspective. i was a core member of the cybersec club at bits goa, where i got hands-on with security and tech. my research interests lie in nlp and mechanistic interpretability.

* while in college, i managed the finances for the [sports fest](https://bits-spree.org/) in 2023. it was a daunting task and came with its fair share of real-life lessons.
