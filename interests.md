### movies

i was introduced to the world of movies by my mom — specifically through bengali classics like [*sonar kella*](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-golden-fortress/) and [*agnishwar*](https://letterboxd.com/film/agnishwar/). these films are invaluable to me, and i’m forever grateful to her for opening this world to me. movies let you explore ideas and experiences you might never encounter in real life, which is what makes them so beautiful. i’ve recently started logging what i watch [here](https://boxd.it/4brIj).

### anime

like many others, naruto was my first anime—I used to watch it back when it aired on animax!
there’s a quote from madara in naruto that really resonates with me:

>"This world is full of things that don't go as you wish. The longer you live the more you realise reality is just made of pain, suffering, and emptiness… Listen… In this world, whenever there is light, there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exist, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars and hatred is born to protect love."

### music

well, there isn’t a single genre i’m obsessed with, but if i had to pick one, it would probably be  [dream pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_pop). i genuinely listen to a lot of music—no irony intended—and you can find my listening history [here](https://www.last.fm/user/aomine2023).
also i listened to coldplay live recently and the experience was surreal.
